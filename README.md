# STA_sector_generator

This is a fun little project I use when GMing Star Trek Adventures by Modiphius. It is based on the chapter "Sector Generation" in the newest Shackleton Expanse sourcebook.
Plans include a complete generation of single sectors but also a mapping of the complete Shackleton Expanse located in the outermost region of the beta quadrant.
